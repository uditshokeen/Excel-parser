# Excel-parser
This Flask application allows users to upload an Excel workbook containing one or more worksheets. The application processes the uploaded Excel file, handles merged cells, and converts the data from each worksheet into a JSON format. It returns a structured JSON response where each worksheet is represented as a separate key in the JSON object.
